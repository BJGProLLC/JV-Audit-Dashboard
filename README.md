# JV-Audit-Dashboard

This project attempts to outline the phases and final product of a project I completed during my time at BHP in the Petroleum division working specficially in their internal JV Audit Group.  

The JV Audit Group has housed all their operated and non-operated audits in an Access Database that the team still continues to use.  The data in the database was always suspect of integrity issues and was always difficult to maintain.  

To counter this issue, Leadership required the team setup a dashboard with a suite of charts and graphs that provided a glimpse of the status of all audits and a potential audit exposure to the specific business units.  

The process of creating these dashboards on a monthly basis prove to be to labourous for the team and the frequency was moved to providing dashboards on a quarterly basis.  

Nevertheless, the process of managing these dashboards always required a data extraction from the Access Database from each process stream lead (approximatley 4) and then using excel to manage/wrangele the data and creating the necessary charts/graphs.  After the each process lead finished with their work, the JV Audit Manager would then copy/paste the graphs/charts from each process stream and put into one powerpoint presentation.  If during the process there were data issues, the changes were made directly in the extracted file (excel) but rarely was any updates made to the Access Database and given the time sensitvity, the process lead did not have time to directly update the Access Database and re-extract the data and repeat the process of creating the same graphs/charts.  

This project initially started as a means of replacing the Access Database and several solutions were attempted but did not work as planned and the process change impact exceeded tolerance levels.  

Then one simple and clever solution was suggested:  Use Spotfire to manage the JV Audit Dashboard.
